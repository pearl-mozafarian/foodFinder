# FoodFinder

##### FoodFinder is a web application that integrates with Foursquare and Google services to help make the best choice for you and others in your food adventures.
It takes away the heart-break of choosing a place to go for lunch, for those important moments in life when no one in your group can decide.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features:
##### For the food-adventurer:
    Why not just roll with it...
>- Use as a guest -
    hit the "Choose for me" button and 10 random restaurants nearby will be shown to you.  The app will show various information and pictures for each restaurant.  Find one you like, hit the "Let's Go" button and your cellphone wil load the map and directions to the restaurant, and you're done.

##### For the Regulars:
        FoodFinder takes into account the places you enjoy, the type of food you enjoy, the amount of time you have, to make the best decision for you.

>- Log in through Facebook -
    Logging in will allow the app to keep track of the restaurants you choose, how often you choose those restaurants, and prevent you from becoming tired of the same routine by suggesting alternative choices.

### TECH STUFF:

#### Future Improvements:
>- Use as a guest with choices -
    Choose a category of food you like, hit Go, and Tada!!! done.
>- Log in -
    Log in through Facebook, choose a category of food you like.  The app will keep track of and determine your favorite food preferences and return more search results of similar types of foods and restaurants.  When you hit the "Choose for me" button, relevant choices that are closer to your liking will be presented to you, and "Where to go for lunch" is a problem of the past.
